# TurnSignal-WS2812B
FastLED Turn Signal with Arduino and WS2812B

A build-up running light, the built-up about 0.2sec stands and then completely off without effect.
A kind of turn signal as in the Audi or VW Golf with push button for Left and Right, when the button is pressed, it will do the effect 3 times.

A big "thank you" goes to the user Hans from the forum tweaking4all.com
